Ariel, listen to me / OO languages? They're a mess / Programming in C / is better than anything they got over there / The syntax might seem much sweeter / Where objects and subtypes play / But frills like inheritance / Will only get in the way! / Admire C's simple landscape / Efficiently dangerous! / No templates or fancy pitfalls... / Like Java and C++! / Program in C / Program in C / Pointers, assembly / Manage your memory / With malloc() and free()! / Don't sink your app with runtime bloat / Software in C will stay afloat / Do what you want there / Close to the hardware! / Program in C / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tas0O586t80
